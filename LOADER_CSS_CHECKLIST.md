# Loader CSS Checklist

This document outlines the checklist to verify the loader CSS logic for the project.

## 1. General Loader CSS Verification
- [ ] Confirm that all loader-related CSS files are present and imported correctly into the project (e.g., in index.html or via bundling).
- [ ] Check the order of CSS files to ensure proper cascading and overrides.
- [ ] Validate that the CSS passes standard linters and W3C validation.

## 2. Specific CSS Property Checks
- [ ] Verify that loader elements use the correct `box-sizing` (e.g., `box-sizing: border-box;` as seen in index.html).
- [ ] Ensure that each loader has appropriate dimensions, margins, and paddings for consistent layout.
- [ ] Check for proper use of CSS transitions and animations:
  - [ ] Verify animation keyframes are defined correctly.
  - [ ] Ensure duration, delay, and timing functions produce smooth animations.

## 3. Loader Element Specifics
- [ ] For each loader type (e.g., spinner, progress bar, etc.):
  - [ ] Confirm that HTML structure and CSS selectors match the expected patterns.
  - [ ] Verify responsive behavior across different device sizes.
  - [ ] Check browser compatibility to ensure consistency on all supported platforms.

## 4. Testing and Debugging Process
- [ ] Create and use a dedicated test page that renders each loader variant.
- [ ] Identify and log any discrepancies or style conflicts during manual testing.
- [ ] Utilize browser developer tools to inspect applied styles and layout issues.

## 5. Automation and Linting
- [ ] Consider integrating CSS linting tools to enforce style guidelines and catch errors early.
- [ ] Explore automated visual regression testing tools to capture styling changes over time.

## 6. Documentation and Iteration
- [ ] Document the purpose and expected behavior for each loader component.
- [ ] Update this checklist as new loader types or style requirements are added.
