# Loader CSS Checklist Report

This report details the current status of each loader CSS check based on our initial investigation.

## 1. General Loader CSS Verification
- [ ] Confirm that all loader-related CSS files are present and imported correctly into the project (e.g., in index.html or via bundling). [Manual verification needed: Found index.html, further assessment required for additional files]
- [ ] Check the order of CSS files to ensure proper cascading and overrides. [Manual review recommended]
- [ ] Validate that the CSS passes standard linters and W3C validation. [Pending linting/validation process]

## 2. Specific CSS Property Checks
- [x] Verify that loader elements use the correct `box-sizing` (verified in index.html on line 28 with `box-sizing: border-box;`).
- [ ] Ensure that each loader has appropriate dimensions, margins, and paddings for consistent layout. [Not verified]
- [ ] Check for proper use of CSS transitions and animations:
  - [ ] Verify animation keyframes are defined correctly. [Not verified]
  - [ ] Ensure duration, delay, and timing functions produce smooth animations. [Not verified]

## 3. Loader Element Specifics
- [ ] For each loader type (e.g., spinner, progress bar, etc.):
  - [ ] Confirm that HTML structure and CSS selectors match the expected patterns. [Requires review of all loader instances]
  - [ ] Verify responsive behavior across different device sizes. [Pending manual testing]
  - [ ] Check browser compatibility to ensure consistency on all supported platforms. [Pending testing]

## 4. Testing and Debugging Process
- [ ] Create and use a dedicated test page that renders each loader variant. [To be set up]
- [ ] Identify and log any discrepancies or style conflicts during manual testing. [In progress]
- [ ] Utilize browser developer tools to inspect applied styles and layout issues. [Recommended during testing]

## 5. Automation and Linting
- [ ] Consider integrating CSS linting tools to enforce style guidelines and catch errors early. [Implementation pending]
- [ ] Explore automated visual regression testing tools to capture styling changes over time. [Not started]

## 6. Documentation and Iteration
- [x] Document the purpose and expected behavior for each loader component (this checklist). [Verified]
- [ ] Update this checklist as new loader types or style requirements are added. [Future update needed]
